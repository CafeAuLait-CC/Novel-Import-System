7. Exceptions

There are many situations where the program may recieve incorrect user inputs. The reasons may be:

	- a typo from user, or

	- the user remembered the table column names wrong.


For example, the user may request to list the 'data_of_birth' of a writer (typo, should be 'date_of_birth'), or the 'gender' of a writer (there is no column called 'gender' in the table).


While the following cases happens, no matter in which mode, the program will print an error message and abort the ongoing operations:

	* user entered incorrect column_name that doesn't match the column_name in the table;

	* user entered incorrect values the may cause the query to fail;

	* insert a record that already exist in the database in 'add mode';

	* delete a record that does not exist in the database in 'delete mode';

	* in 'delete mode', when searching a book title but the program returns multiple results (same book title, different publisher and ISBN-13);

	* the requested table does not exist, etc...
